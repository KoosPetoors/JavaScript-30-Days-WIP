# JavaScript-30-Days
30 projects from Wes Bos's titular challenge to solidfy JavaScript skills. He provides all the CSS and HTML so this is purely JS practice.

Some projects will deviate from Wes's framework, where I have put my own spin on them for extra practice.

How-To:

1. Open the project folder of your choosing
2. See project readme for further details on what skill(s) the project demonstrates
3. Click on title html to open project.
